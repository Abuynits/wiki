ARC currently holds shop space at BIDC. Students can use this space for manufacturing and assembling parts, hosting project meetings and storing equipment.

Anyone looking to use the space must complete the required trainings. To do this, [join the BIDC group on passport](https://www.openpassport.org/Group/PurdueBIDC) and obtain the following badges:
- [Bechtel Center - Member Agreement](https://www.openpassport.org/Badge/Bechtel-Center-Membership/Criteria)
- [Bechtel Assembly - Member Agreement](https://www.openpassport.org/Badge/AssemblyAgreement/Criteria)
- [Bechtel Assembly - Safety & PPE](https://www.openpassport.org/Badge/MakeAssemblySafe/Criteria)

Additional badges are required for manufacturing tasks such as using the drill press, vertical bandsaw, etc.

## Card Swipe Access

BIDC only grants ARC a limited number of positions for people with card swipe access. Because of this, we try to equally divide those with access across each project.

To have a meeting at BIDC, you need to ensure at least one of the attending members will have swipe access to let everyone else in.

The current swipe list is:
- Rocket League
    - Harrison McCarty (mccarth at purdue.edu)
    - James Baxter (baxter26 at purdue.edu)
    - Robert Ketler (rketler at purdue.edu)
