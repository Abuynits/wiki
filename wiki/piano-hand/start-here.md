## Goal

### Mission
The mission of this project is to explore the perspective of robotics in terms of the aspect of replicating human-motion. A primary fascination in this is looking at tasks that might help us understand biomechanics, which is a more recent booming area of robotics. 

The goal of the project is to build a fully autonomous robot arm that can play the piano. The Human hand, with 27 degrees of freedom has so far been the most dextrous mechanism to play the piano and the closer we get to replicating that degree of freedom and movement, the better it is to move the arm and play the piano.

Along the way, we will publish our progress, code, tutorials and workshops.

### Right Now
Right now, we're planning the project out, making a timeline, organizing subteams and then getting started with building hardware/software for a servo-

- A team of researchers attempted replicating the pressure applied in the grasping mechanism and achieved 17 degrees of freedom in a 5-finger hand. The actuators used are the most interesting: McKibben Actuators, which move on the basis of difference in Air Pressure. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005743000102"> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005743000102 </a>
