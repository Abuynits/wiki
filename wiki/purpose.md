Welcome to the Autonomous Robotics Club (ARC) Wiki!

## Purpose

Robotics isn't easy. The goal of this wiki is to provide the details and reasoning behind the progress of the various robotics projects created at ARC, so new members can contribute effectively to projects and for visitors to find inspiration and build off of our projects.
