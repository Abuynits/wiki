This tutorial aims to streamline the transfer of your robot to simulation and will provide step-by-step instructions for turning a robot arm CAD model to a Gazebo simulation that can be controlled with MoveIt/ROS.

## Prerequisites
- ROS installed and setup (If you don't have ROS setup, see [here](% link wiki/tutorials/setup-ros.md %)) 
- Understanding of how ROS works, navigating the file structure, basic commands, etc 
- A CAD model of the robot arm 

## Exporting your CAD model to URDF
